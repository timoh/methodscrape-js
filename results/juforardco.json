    "We had a great Content Marketing collaboration with Timur Taepov, founder of Justforward.co. At AppTweak, we love finding valuable ways to spread and communicate useful content. Timur’s contribution on our blog has been a huge success and appreciated by our users, thanks!",
    "When we launched Avtodrug, we clearly understood that we needed organic traffic and that it would not be enough to simply publish an app in the App Stores. A very respected man in the mobile industry recommended Timur Taepov to us. Timur met the project deadline and gave us 70% growth in our daily organic traffic. Now we rank in top positions for a number of keywords that undoubtedly is a result of Timur's activities.",
