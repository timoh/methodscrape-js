    "“More content is being created in 48 hours than what was produced from the beginning of time until 2003.” – Eric Schmidt",
    "It’s difficult to comprehend how much content is being produced, isn’t it? Did you know there are more than 2 million blog posts published every single day? It wasn’t long ago when I was updating web content once or twice per year; yet now you have websites like Huffington Post that update content more than a thousand times per day. Sounds crazy, right?",
    "And creating all this content doesn’t come cheap either, as B2B marketers are spending more time, money, and resources on content than ever before, as:",
    "Even though content spending is increasing, traditional marketers are struggling with the shift from outbound marketing to inbound marketing – and moving from a push to a pull strategy. If you have ever been asked if content marketing really works or why it’s important, read on and share with the inquisitors.",
    "Well, it’s because of charts like these (organic traffic growth):",
    "",
    "It’s not easy to go from 300 organic visits per month to more than 9,000 organic visits per month. Look at the first three to six months, zero impact … and then, it skyrockets.",
    "It’s not luck either, and it took two years of hard-fought battles, failing with certain content and succeeding with experimental content. It’s trial and error at scale.",
    "Let me be blunt: Most content marketing efforts fail. Why?",
    "It’s because most content strategies start with a brainstorming session to generate ideas on what to write about. The content teams then go out and write, publish, and move on to the next piece of content.",
    "And then six months later, the report looks like this:",
    "",
    "This kind of scenario happens a lot. You create the content, hit “publish,” and expect visits, leads, and sales to explode overnight. It’s a nice story, but it rarely happens that way. And yet, when done right, content marketing will be your most powerful source for new traffic and customer acquisition.",
    "What if, instead of seeing the previous chart, you begin to see charts like this for a single piece of content:",
    "",
    "This content gets 2.5 times more views per week that it did when it was first launched.",
    "So how do you create this kind of content? Let me outline the exact steps you need to launch a successful content marketing campaign with these five pillars.",
    "Before you start creating your content, you need to understand for whom you are writing. Ask:",
    "To answer this, most companies create customer profiles or buyer personas. A buyer persona is a term used for creating personas based on types of customers that your business has and wants.",
    "An example of a buyer persona might be Cool Kevin, a 35-year-old CMO at Big Corporation LLC. Cool Kevin is tech savvy and has experience in using marketing automation software. The content you produce for Cool Kevin will differ from the content for Boring Bob, a 55-year-old administrative assistant who has just been given the task of sending out his first email newsletter to clients.",
    "How do you develop buyer personas? According to a MarketingSherpa survey, the most frequently cited effective tactics are:",
    "",
    "Once you have the personas in place, use them to create content and solve problems. The key to your content is to help your customers help themselves, and the only way to do that is to understand your audience. If you do not understand your audience, your content will fail.",
    "Image source: CMI article published in March 2014",
    "As a marketer, you need to create content to meet the needs of your prospects at each stage to help them move to the next stage of the funnel.",
    "Content must be tailored to appeal to different prospects and at different stages. Just how different? Let’s take a look at an example. If a buyer is considering a one-time license fee for software that costs $50, you might write about the benefits of the software in two to three paragraphs and include one to two customer testimonials. However, if a buyer is purchasing several hundred licenses for software that cost $100,000, then the content should be much different. In this case, you might need to create case studies, product sheets, and integration guides (or all three).",
    "This theory is backed up by data. A recent survey by MarketingCharts analyzed six types of content and how useful the respondents found the content during each stage of the buying cycle.",
    "",
    "Let’s break it down so you can see exactly what type of content to produce.",
    "Awareness",
    "Create content to increase your brand awareness. At this stage of the cycle, the buyer may not have heard of your brand and the content you create should be focused on promoting your brand.",
    "Awareness content formats: Blog post articles, white papers, educational webinars, and infographics",
    "Evaluation",
    "Create content to increase the number of marketing qualified leads (MQL). At this stage, the buyer is still not ready to make a decision but understands that your brand is a leader in this field.",
    "Evaluation content formats: Case studies, product webinars, video, and technology guides",
    "Purchase",
    "Create content to turn a marketing qualified lead into a sales qualified lead (SQL). At this stage, the prospect is getting closer to making a decision and the content should make it easy to choose your product over a competitor’s.",
    "Purchase content formats: Implementation guides, free trials, and live demonstrations",
    "You now understand the customer and know what type of content goes with each stage of the sales cycle. Now it’s time to create different types of content that decision-makers seek to read.",
    "I can help you here, too. A recent report from the CMO Council and NetLine found that 65% of B2B buyers value research reports and studies compared to any other content type (followed by technical guides, insight, white papers, and articles).",
    "",
    "What about content length? How long should your content be? A study by serpIQ found that longer content ranks higher in the Google search results than shorter content.",
    "And the magic number of words you need to write to rank in the top 10? It’s 2,000.",
    "",
    "That’s right – if you want to increase traffic and show that your content marketing efforts are adding value for your business, short 400-word posts are not good enough (unless you’re Seth Godin).",
    "Another benefit to writing more is that longer content is shared more on social networks.",
    "",
    "Content that’s more than 3,000 words is shared two to three times more than content that’s less than 1,000 words. And that’s not all, longer content will get you more inbound links, which is great for SEO purposes.",
    "",
    "To clarify, longer content will help you:",
    "Now, are you sure you want to continue writing those 400-word blog posts?",
    "Let’s put the first three pillars to good use. Imagine Cool Kevin (audience), who is an experienced marketing automation user, wants to learn new ways to use your software (stage of sales cycle). You can create a how-to guide (content) to help him become a power user.",
    "Boring Bob (audience), who is new to email marketing (stage of sales cycle), needs to create his first email blast. You can create the “Beginner’s Guide to Email Marketing” (content) to help him get started.",
    "You have to remember that content marketing is part content, part MARKETING. And, unfortunately, content cannot promote itself. As Upworthy CEO Eli Periser says, “You can have the best piece of content and make the best point ever. But if no one looks at it, the article is a waste.”",
    "You need to push out your content as soon as it goes live and promote the hell out of it. Otherwise, you end up with content that no one shares and a visual reminder like this:",
    "",
    "At the very least, if you create content, you should advertise it through social media. If you are too embarrassed to share your content, then you need to create better content. If you create content that you are proud to share, then others will share your content, too.",
    "The promotion of your content will largely depend on the campaign. While a blog post may be shared on social networks, a new white paper might require a bigger push in the form of paid content amplification.",
    "Here are a few ways to promote your content:",
    "It’s easy to click “publish” and forget about content, but that’s where a lot of content marketers go wrong. Did the content perform well? Did the content perform as you expected? You need to measure how well your content performs and analyze its progress.",
    "To measure the content marketing success metrics, ask yourself these questions:",
    "Once you can answer those questions, you will have much more data to analyze and use for the next time you create content.",
    "I’ve collected data on several months of traffic to the SuperOffice blog:",
    "",
    "Looking at this data, two things are immediately clear:",
    "Therefore, it makes sense to write more about customer service, doesn’t it? It ranks as most visited and most shared.",
    "I use my own guest blog posts as content marketing case studies by analyzing the data of what topics/keywords work well.",
    "I’m able to quickly identify that content that is more than 1,500 words and hosted on an authoritative website that will result in a higher ranking, which helps me narrow my future targeted keywords and guest post opportunities.",
    "As I mentioned, most content marketing efforts fail. But when done right, they can transform your business and turn your website into a traffic and lead-generation machine. By implementing a successful content marketing strategy:",
    "The tips in this post will save you the years of guesswork and continuous optimization that I had to endure to see success. Use these five pillars as a guide to help you create valuable content for members of your audience and move them from one buying stage to the next, and continue to measure and analyze performance.",

    "Very nice complete run down of content marketing in a nutshell Steven. I knew that long content 1500-3000 typically ranked highest but I never knew it related to shares too. Looks like there isn’t much point in writing SUPER long articles for web content. Ive just finished writing 7000 words and think Ill start to break it up into smaller digestible articles.",
    "Thanks for the comment, Paul.",
    "I think it’s great that you have a 7,000 word piece, but I do think that you will see better results by breaking it up into smaller pieces, as you suggest.",
    "The best part about having a 7,000 word article is the numerous ways you can repurpose it (ie, take 6-8 pieces of data from the post and turn it into an infographic).",
    "this is what im planning on doing, thanks for the advice",
    "You’re welcome, Paul. Let me know if there’s anything else I can help you with.",
    "Thank you for sharing these valuable guidelines.  I was happy to have the B2B technology examples!\nOverall, google is bit like fad diets- what is good for google is not always every businesses best marketing match for content. The catch is that what is good for google is good for business. So, perhaps content marketers may need to meet both google optimizing content and other customer needs (graphic heavy content maybe?)",
    "Glad to hear you enjoyed the post.",
    "And you’re absolutely  right. I think optimizing for Google and the user is a perfect match –  Optimizing your content for search will generate visits and optimizing your content for the user will generate sales.",
    "Very interesting article. As a freelance content creator, this is useful ammunition when pitching to prospective clients.\nBut does the 2,000-word rule also apply when marketing to consumers? I work on mainly automotive content, so that would be pretty long for a review-style piece of content.",
    "Thanks Craig!",
    "The 2,000 word guideline is based on research by SerpIQ for content that ranks well. But, there are ways around this, if you feel it’s too long for consumers. ",
    "For example, you could create content that is broken up the same way that image sliders do for images on products. Or, you could hide the majority of the content and allow readers to click “read more” to expand it for further reading.\nIt’s definitely something to test out in order to see what works best.",
    "Definitely sharing with my  Phoenix SEO firm . I want to say one of those is 5 pillars is more important than the rest, but it is so hard. Maybe the “creating content” one is most important because without that, you have no content marketing.",
    "Glad you like it.",
    "That’s a great point – Without the content, you don’t have anything to show for the work done on the other four!",
    "The stats are very useful – helps convince senior management to increase efforts/spend etc.  The Likes vs Shares and Visits vs Leads are very interesting indeed.  Together with the sales cycle matching discipline, it really helps focus content creation efforts.  Thanks for posting",
    "Thanks Simon, I appreciate the kind words.",
    "And if this doesn’t convince senior management,  I’m not sure anything will.",
    "Very nice thank you!\nDefinitely didn’t know the bit about the 2000 word min… kinda counter-intuitive",
    "Glad you liked the post",
    "Great thankful to your article post and  you done a very impressive work on this essential topic.",
