    "Customer acquisition is the process of acquiring new customers for business or converting existing prospects into new customers. The importance of customer acquisition varies according to the specific business situation of an organisation.\nThe process is specifically concerned with issues such as acquiring customers at lower cost, acquiring as many customers as possible, acquiring customers who are indigenous and business oriented, and acquiring customers who utilise newer business channels.",
    "Good product, good marketing, good customer support, and so forth – these are the first things that come to my mind when I think of what I need to get new customers. But this is not enough: first of all, you want something from your leads – you want them to turn into your customers. So you must first to get to know them and what they are interested in. You have to actually look into your customers heads to understand what they are thinking. There are some quite simple ways to get more customers using psychology.",
    "Identify which type of buyers are visiting your site, and target your marketing message to them.",
    "Customers have more trust in companies who are willing to take responsibility for their failures than for those who try to blame external sources – that’s a fact. So if you fail to deliver on time, apologise and pledge to put effort into correcting this.",
    "Depending on what you are selling, you must explain precisely what it looks like. If you are selling a product, explain how big it is, how much it weighs, how much it will cost to deliver, etc. If you have a service, explain how long it will take, what it will do, and how it will do it. All the things that may be obvious to you are not obvious to your potential buyers. The more you tell them, the easier it looks, and the more of them will buy.",
    "Adding this element to your website can multiply your profits and also get your customers selling your products for you. By using reviews and comments from your satisfied customers (text or video) you also transform your sales pitch into a recommendation for your product. By using testimonials, you can overcome buyer scepticism and generate more selling power. So how do you choose the right testimonial? Do not overdo it! Do not write things such as “The product is just awesome, I can’t get enough of it. The best thing I have ever bought”. This says nothing to other potential customers, and it is also exaggerated. Instead of this, use benefit-driven expressions such as, “I used the product/service like you told me and it is working! I sold over $3,500 in goods and services in three days! It’s the first time in five months that anyone had really purchased anything.”",
    "Email marketing is a powerful tool for many online retailers. It can be overlooked as a method to gain new customers, but it works. Make it very clear in your message that you want your site visitors to register for a newsletter, discounts, or special offers. Once you have a lead’s email address, the salesperson will get many new opportunities to convert that subscriber into a paying customer.",
    "You should be willing to sell where your shoppers are. To sell products through other channels in addition to your e commerce site is still a growing trend for merchants. If you rely only on your own online store, there’s a huge possibility that you will be left behind, because consumer shopping behaviours are changing rapidly.",
    " ",
    "Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Sears, and many other large retail sites with millions of visitors also allow small and mid-sized retailers to sell directly from their sites. When orders start coming in, be sure to include discounts and coupons in the delivery package, inviting customers to return directly to your site.",
    "Although the payment process should be straightforward, users shouldn’t feel as if their options are restricted. Keep in mind that there may be some who are purchasing your product as a present. So, offer services such as gift wrapping, receipts, personalised notes, and returns. Sometimes you can offer free delivery, special deals, or freebies – people like to get something extra or free. Therefore, discounts and promotional offers are often the first things that website visitors look for.",
    "A distinctive logo is a business card for both start-up shops and branded e commerce. When it comes to online shopping, a recognisable logo is a symbol and an element of trust. The more popular brands can afford to create an online store with a fashionable home page displaying a minimum of features. A well-known logo, a beautiful image, and the ‘Buy’ button will suffice for such designs.",
    "Use tools like Colibri Search Engine Growth Hacking Tool to deeply understand what your customers are searching for and how they convert in each sales funnel. Reveal new sales channels and improve your on-page SEO and backlinks targeting to your landing pages.",
