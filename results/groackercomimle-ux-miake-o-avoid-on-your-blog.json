    "hey, great article. One thing though: your Flare add-on is overlapping the text of the article on your blog... that's not such a great UX example :) screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0l4phf75xhqllg5/Screenshot%202015-04-23%2009.43.33.png?dl=0",
    "Thanks for pointing this out Rachel. I just pushed some changes to account for this. Didn't notice it in my local version since Flare only works on the production site. Glad you like the article in spite of the ironic Flare positioning... :)",
    "Very interesting perspective. Have good user experience not only can make users easier to navigate through your site, but also good for SEO. After all, UX has been part of ranking factors",
    "The Google Panda release really hammered this home. Engagement and UX as a whole is really starting to play a role. Best to get out ahead of that. It's pretty cool now that focussing on the reader's experience will directly relate to better rankings now at an increasing rate.",
