    "Thanks for your feedback, Joseph. It is a fascinating space to be in.",
    "Loving the social activity on the post, great job Paul!",
    "Thank @pauljacobson for sharing his!",
    "Are there really companies that are still relaying on media buying?",
    "Yes, and you won't believe it but some of them actually make it work.",
    "Did you watch the superbowl? All of those companies bought media --though not programmatically.",
    "Eventually all companies saturate their early markets and need to start with big splashy advertising of some sort. There really isnt a way around this.",
    "The Superbowl will eventually be programmatic as well, every live event will be at some point.",
    "I disagree.",
    "Thats like saying that the \"Staples\" sponsorship of the \"Staples Center\" here in LA would be sold programmatically.",
    "There is too much that goes into these types of deals and they are EXTREMELY valuable.",
    "The transaction may occur programmatically, but I guarantee that people will always be involved in deals like this.",
    "10 year sponsorship deals are not the same as 30 second half time commercials, don't you agree?",
    "I worked as a data engineer at a DSP (demand-side supplier, we do the bidding) and now I work in growth. Word of advice...implement advanced conversion tracking with conversion event id ( order id) pass back!",
    "Hello Brad, i ve been working for companies that use large DSP, i have an inquiry from a much smaller company which wants to go programmatic but fails to find a DSP that would work with them for less than $15.000 monthly spend. Do you have any idea of a DSP that would be both reliable and ready to work on smaller volumes ?",
